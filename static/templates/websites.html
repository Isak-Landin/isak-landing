    <h2>Designed Around You</h2>
    <p>Each project begins with understanding your business and your audience. I don’t reuse templates or rely on platforms that limit what you can do. Your site is purpose-built, adaptable, and created with future growth in mind.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re launching a product, showcasing your work, or automating a business process — we’ll shape the site to fit those goals from the start.</p>

      <h2>Clean Code, Full Ownership</h2>
      <p>I avoid bloated page builders and unnecessary third-party tools. Each website is built to be fast, efficient, and free from lock-ins — no clutter, no surprises.</p>
      <p>The code is yours to own and easy to understand. Whether you update it yourself or hand it off to someone else, the structure is clear and fully documented.</p>

      <h2>Performance Comes First</h2>
      <p>Most visitors leave a site within seconds if it’s slow or clunky. That’s why I focus on speed from day one — image optimization, minimal dependencies, and zero unused libraries.</p>
      <p>From SEO to user experience, your website should feel fast and trustworthy the moment it loads. I don’t just build it to work — I build it to perform.</p>
