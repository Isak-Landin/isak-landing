    <h2>Designed Around You</h2>
    <p>Each project begins with understanding your business and your audience. I don’t reuse templates or rely on platforms that limit what you can do. Your site is purpose-built, adaptable, and created with future growth in mind.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re launching a product, showcasing your work, or automating a business process — we’ll shape the site to fit those goals from the start.</p>

      <h2>Clean Code, Full Ownership</h2>
      <p>I handwrite every line — no CMS bloat or third-party lock-ins. The result is a clean, lightweight site you can host anywhere. You’ll own every file and have the freedom to maintain or expand the site on your terms.</p>
      <p>Need future edits or want to hand it off to another dev? Easy. The project is structured for clarity and documentation is included.</p>

      <h2>Performance Comes First</h2>
      <p>Most visitors leave a site within seconds if it’s slow or clunky. That’s why I focus on speed from day one — image optimization, minimal dependencies, and zero unused libraries.</p>
      <p>From SEO to user experience, your website should feel fast and trustworthy the moment it loads. I don’t just build it to work — I build it to perform.</p>
